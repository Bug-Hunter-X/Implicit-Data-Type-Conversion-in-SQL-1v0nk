The corrected query explicitly casts the data type to ensure accurate comparison.  For example, if comparing a string column ('col1') to a numeric value (10), the solution would involve casting 'col1' to a numeric type before the comparison. The exact casting function (`CAST`, `CONVERT`, etc.) depends on the specific SQL dialect.

Example:

-- Incorrect query (implicit conversion)
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE col1 = 10; 

-- Correct query (explicit conversion)
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE CAST(col1 AS INT) = 10;
